# decidim-app

Free Open-Source participatory democracy, citizen participation and open government for cities and organizations

This is the open-source repository for decidim-mozambique, based on [Decidim](https://github.com/decidim/decidim).

[![Test](https://github.com/gasparbucuane/DECIDIM/actions/workflows/test.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/gasparbucuane/DECIDIM/actions/workflows/test.yml)

This is the instance for Decidim mozambique https://to-be-defined

## Server configuration

Docker & Docker Compose is needed, then clone this repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/gasparbucuane/DECIDIM decidim-production
```

or update:
```
cd decidim-production
git pull
```

Ensure the `.env` file has these values defined:

```bash
POSTGRES_USER=XXXXXX
POSTGRES_PASSWORD=XXXXXX
POSTGRES_DB=XXXXXX
SECRET_KEY_BASE=XXXXXX
MAPS_API_KEY=XXXXXX
EMAIL=XXXXXX
SMTP_USERNAME=XXXXXX
SMTP_PASSWORD=XXXXXX
SMTP_ADDRESS=XXXXXX
SMTP_DOMAIN=XXXXXX
SMTP_PORT=XXXXXX
DECIDIM_ENV=production
```

### SSL configuration

This application uses Traefik to handle the certificates with Let's Encrypt.
You need to ensure that the env var `DECIDIM_HOST` is set to a valid hostname pointing to the server's ip.

## Deploy

### Pull from Github Repository

This instance uses Docker Compose to deploy the application into the port 80 and 443 using Traefik as a web proxy.

> **Apply these instructions if the repository is in an organization**
> First, you need to make sure you are logged into the Github Docker registry (ghcr.io).
>
> 1. Go to your personal Github account, into tokens settings https://github.com/settings/tokens
> 2. Generate a new token (Classic)
> 3. Ensure you check the permission "read:packages" and "No expiration".
> 4. In the server, login into docker, introduce your username and the token generated:
>   ```bash
>   docker login ghcr.io --username github-username
>   ```
> 5. You should stay logged permanently, you should not need to repeat this process.

To re-deploy the image this should suffice:

```bash
cd decidim-production
git pull
docker compose up -d
```

### Locally building the Docker image

This instance uses Docker Compose to deploy the application with Traefik as a proxy.

> If you want to locally build the docker image, change the line `image: ghcr.io/gasparbucuane/DECIDIM:${GIT_REF:-main}` for `image: decidim_${DECIDIM_ENV:-production}` first!

You need to build and tag the image:

1. Ensure you have the ENV value `DECIDIM_ENV=staging` or `DECIDIM_ENV=production`
2. Run:
   `./build.sh`
3. Deploy:
  `docker compose up -d`

## Backups

Database is backup every day using https://github.com/tiredofit/docker-db-backup (see docker-compose.yml for details)

Backups are stored in:

- `backups/*`

## Setting up the application

You will need to do some steps before having the app working properly once you've deployed it:

1. Open a Rails console in the server: `bundle exec rails console`
2. Create a System Admin user:

```ruby
user = Decidim::System::Admin.new(email: <email>, password: <password>, password_confirmation: <password>)
user.save!
```

3. Visit `<your app url>/system` and login with your system admin credentials
4. Create a new organization. Check the locales you want to use for that organization, and select a default locale.
5. Set the correct default host for the organization, otherwise the app will not work properly. Note that you need to include any subdomain you might be using.
6. Fill the rest of the form and submit it.

You're good to go!
